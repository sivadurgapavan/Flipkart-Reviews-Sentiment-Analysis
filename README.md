# 🛍️ Flipkart Product Reviews Sentiment Analyzer

This project is a Machine Learning-powered web application that analyzes product reviews from Flipkart and predicts the sentiment as **Positive**, **Negative**, or **Neutral**. It's built using Python, trained with real review data, and deployed using Streamlit Cloud.

## 📚 Dataset Overview

* **Columns**:

  * `product_name`: Name of the product
  * `product_price`: Price in ₹
  * `Rate`: User rating (1–5)
  * `Review`: Full review text
  * `Summary`: Summary of review
  * `Sentiment`: Target label — Positive, Negative, Neutral

* **Preprocessing**:

  * Lowercasing, removing HTML and special characters
  * Cleaned `Summary` field used for training
  * Balanced dataset across 3 sentiment classes

---

## ✨ Future Improvements

* Use a transformer-based model like BERT for deeper understanding
* Add visualization of sentiment distribution
* Batch upload of multiple reviews via CSV
* Multilingual review support (e.g., Hindi, Tamil)
